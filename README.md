# scribal

> Test Specification Display Generator

The goal of Scribal is to help create a readable representation of a test specification repository that is based on Gherkin.

This code is based on a similar tool called [FeatureBook](https://github.com/SOFTWARE-CLINIC/featurebook). One of my concerns with FeatureBook is that it was not adhering to Gherkin 4.x, which is the latest evolution of Gherkin. So I have updated it accordingly as well as a few other updates, such as moving from Jade (now deprecated) to Pug.
